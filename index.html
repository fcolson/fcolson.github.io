        <p><strong>I collaborated with Evan Marcus, Umair Ahmed, Victor Schmitt, and Weston Pangle to create a 3D platformer party game where you play as a robot and compete to collect the most trash and toss it in the bin. We developed four levels and we genuinely enjoy playing it.</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> Unity, C#.</p>

        <h2>Buff Cube (aka P2 Gold)</h2>
        <p><a href="https://fcolson.itch.io/p2-gold">Play Buff Cube</a></p>
        <p><strong>Tasks I did for this project:</strong> Designed from the ground up, a 2D platformer where the main mechanic is throwing. You have to throw to hit targets and buttons, and you also need to throw in order to get across the level.</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> Unity, C#.</p>

        <h2>Zelda-Like Game</h2>
        <p><a href="https://fcolson.itch.io/zelda-dungeon">Play Zelda-Like Game</a></p>
        <p><strong>Tasks I did for this project:</strong> Developed grid-based movement, sword, bow, and boomerang mechanics. Created player sprites, Goriya, Gel enemies, water tiles, and pushable blocks. Designed a custom 2D Bow room with an audio manager and five custom rooms. Created a custom bat-Link collectible with fire animation for transitions.</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> Unity, C#, Adobe Photoshop for sprite creation.</p>
